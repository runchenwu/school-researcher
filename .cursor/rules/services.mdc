# Services

## AI Service
- Located in `src/services/aiService.ts`
- Supports OpenAI, Gemini, and Anthropic
- Returns `ResearchResponse` with content and optional schools array
- School data is extracted from JSON blocks in AI responses

## File Naming
- Services: camelCase with `Service` suffix (`aiService.ts`)

## Service Pattern
- Export singleton instance: `export const aiService = new AIService()`
- Use async/await for all API calls
- Handle errors gracefully with try/catch
- Return typed responses
